# Structural Equation Modeling with `R` and `lavaan`
 This repository contains class materials for a 2022 3-day course in Structural Equation Modeling at the University of Bamberg.
 
 ## Description

The workshop introduced participants to the *structural equation modeling* (SEM) framework, and to how a set of basic but flexible SEM specifications can be estimated with the help of the `R` statistical environment and the `lavaan` package. In the 3 days devoted to this topic, we covered the fundamentals of observed-variable (path) models, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) models, and full structural regression models. During this progression to ever-more complex specifications we touched upon aspects of graphical presentation of such models, estimation, local and global fit testing, as well as sample size considerations. In the final day of the workshop, we discussed how the SEM and the MLM frameworks can be joined to understand how latent traits impact outcomes differentially across different contexts. The sessions were conducted entirely in `R`, and the `lavaan` package. The theoretical material was primarily based on selected chapters from Rex Kline's *Principles and Practice of Structural Equation Modeling* (4th edition).
